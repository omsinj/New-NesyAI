MODEL 1: BASELINE (Black-Box AI)
⚙️ Goal:
Detect disinformation using a traditional deep learning classifier, with high accuracy, but limited transparency.

🔧 Architecture Overview:

Input Text (e.g. news headline or article)
    ↓
Tokenizer (e.g. BERT tokenizer)
    ↓
Pretrained Language Model (e.g. DistilBERT / BERT)
    ↓
CLS Token Embedding
    ↓
Feedforward Classification Layer
    ↓
Output: Binary Label (Real / Fake)
🧠 Tools & Libraries:
Transformers (transformers by HuggingFace)

PyTorch or TensorFlow

Tokeniser + model weights (BERT, RoBERTa, or DistilBERT)

📦 Output:
Probability or softmax score for each class

No direct insight into “why” a classification was made

🧠 MODEL 2: NEURO-SYMBOLIC AI (Transparent Model)
⚙️ Goal:
Blend neural pattern recognition with symbolic reasoning, so outputs are explainable to intelligence analysts.

Stage 1: Neural Model
---------------------
Input Text
    ↓
Tokenizer (BERT-style)
    ↓
Pretrained Neural Encoder (BERT/DistilBERT)
    ↓
Text Embeddings or Prediction Candidates

Stage 2: Symbolic Reasoner
--------------------------
    ↓
Extracted features, keywords, or output logits
    ↓
Rule-based engine / decision tree / logic program
    ↓
Symbolic Reasoning + Domain Knowledge Rules (e.g., "if source is unverified AND sentiment is extreme → likely disinfo")
    ↓
Final Output + Explanation
💡 Symbolic Layer Options:
Logic rules: Custom-written, e.g., using sympy, pyknow, or simple conditionals

Decision Tree over embeddings: Easily interpretable paths

Neural Theorem Provers (advanced): e.g., DeepProbLog, but requires more setup

Post-hoc explainers: LIME/SHAP to generate rule-like justifications (limited, not truly symbolic)

🧠 Tools & Libraries:
HuggingFace Transformers

Scikit-learn (for decision trees)

PyKnow, SymPy, or custom symbolic engine

Optional: LIME, SHAP, alibi

📦 Output:
Classification + human-readable rationale (e.g., “Predicted as disinfo because it matches 3 risk indicators: source + language + lack of evidence”)

🔍 Comparison Table
Feature	Baseline Model	NeSy AI Model
Accuracy	High (with BERT)	High-to-Moderate (depends on rules)
Explainability	Low	High
Speed	Fast	Slower (especially with symbolic layer)
Fit for Intelligence Ops	Poor (black-box risk)	Strong (transparent reasoning)
Effort to Build	Moderate	High (especially logic/rule engineering)
Customisation	Low	High (rules tailored to use-case)
