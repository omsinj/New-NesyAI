 Step 1: Define the Symbolic Knowledge Base
Weâ€™ll build a prototype logic layer that checks consistency between claims and known facts/rules (e.g., using rule-based filters to flag suspicious content).

python
Copy
# Define a symbolic rule base (example: simple logic for disinformation patterns)
KNOWN_FACTS = {
    "Zelensky_resigned": False,
    "US_elections_delayed": False,
    "COVID_is_a_hoax": False,
}

# Example symbolic rules
RULES = {
    "disinfo_keywords": ["breaking", "exclusive", "exposed", "shocking", "secret"],
    "contradiction_triggers": [
        ("Zelensky", "resigned"),
        ("US elections", "delayed"),
        ("COVID", "hoax")
    ]
}
ðŸ§  Step 2: Define the Logic Reasoner
This function receives a sentence or claim and applies symbolic rules to detect inconsistencies or suspicious framing.

python
Copy
def symbolic_reasoner(text, neural_label=None):
    reasons = []

    # Keyword-based suspicion
    for kw in RULES["disinfo_keywords"]:
        if kw.lower() in text.lower():
            reasons.append(f"Uses suspicious framing: '{kw}'")

    # Fact contradiction
    for subject, action in RULES["contradiction_triggers"]:
        if subject.lower() in text.lower() and action.lower() in text.lower():
            fact_key = f"{subject.replace(' ', '_')}_{action}"
            if fact_key in KNOWN_FACTS and KNOWN_FACTS[fact_key] is False:
                reasons.append(f"Contradicts known fact: {subject} has not {action}")

    # Merge symbolic output with neural label (if any)
    if neural_label is not None:
        reasons.append(f"Neural model predicted: {neural_label}")

    return {
        "text": text,
        "symbolic_reasons": reasons,
        "verdict": "disinformation" if reasons else "uncertain"
    }
ðŸ§ª Step 3: Try It Out
Let's simulate the logic layer running on an input claim:

python
Copy
sample_claim = "Breaking: Zelensky has resigned amid scandal!"
result = symbolic_reasoner(sample_claim, neural_label="disinformation")

from pprint import pprint
pprint(result)
Expected Output:

python
Copy
{
 'text': 'Breaking: Zelensky has resigned amid scandal!',
 'symbolic_reasons': [
   "Uses suspicious framing: 'breaking'",
   'Contradicts known fact: Zelensky has not resigned',
   'Neural model predicted: disinformation'
 ],
 'verdict': 'disinformation'
}

 Next Steps
We can extend this by:

Replacing KNOWN_FACTS with facts extracted from a live or curated knowledge base (e.g., Wikidata, FactCheck APIs).

Parsing syntactic/semantic structures for richer rule application (using spaCy).

Connecting this to your trained neural classifier output.
